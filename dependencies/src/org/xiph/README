********************************************************************

Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the
month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
All the technical details are published and documented, and any
software entity may make full use of the format without license 
fee, royalty or patent concerns.

This package contains a native java port of:

* libvorbis, a BSD-style license Java software implementation of
  the Vorbis specification by the Xiph.Org Foundation 
  (http://www.xiph.org/) 

* libogg, a BSD-style license Java software implementation which 
  uses the Ogg bitstream format to arrange the raw,
  compressed bitstream into a more robust, useful form
  (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/)

* libshout, a GNU-style license Java software implementation library 
  for communicating with and sending data to an icecast jops.server
  (http://www.icecast.org/download.php)

WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes libvorbis and an example
encoder to demonstrate use of libvorbis as well as
documentation on the Ogg Vorbis audio coding format.

A more comprehensive set of Java utilities WILL BE available in the vorbis-tools
package.
